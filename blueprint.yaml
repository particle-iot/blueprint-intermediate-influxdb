introduction: |
  This blueprint shows how to configure an InfluxDB time series database integration to stream data from your Particle device to the cloud.
description: |
  This tutorial walks you through setting up an InfluxDB time series database integration with Particle:

  - Creating an InfluxDB bucket and API token
  - Configuring Particle Cloud Secrets for secure credential storage
  - Setting up a custom webhook to send data to InfluxDB
  - Publishing time series data from your device firmware

  The firmware periodically publishes JSON data which triggers the webhook to insert records into your InfluxDB instance.
